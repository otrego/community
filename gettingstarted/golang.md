# The Go Programming Language

One of our primary languages is the
[Go (AKA Golang) programming language](https://golang.org/). In Otrego we will
largely use the term "Golang" as opposed to "Go", to avoid ambiguity with the
game.

## Installing

*   [Download from the Golang Website](https://golang.org/dl/)
*   If you are on OSX, you can also install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

### Installing Tools

We use golint for linting our go-files.

```shell
go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
```

## Workflows

### Building and Testing

Make sure the repository builds, assuming you're in `clamshell` repository or
some othe other repository that uses Golang:

Build the sources:

```shell
# Build current package (current directory)
go build

# Build all packages recursively
go build  ./...
```

Build & test the sources:

```shell
# Build and test current package (current directory)
go test ./...

# Test all packages recursively
go test ./...
```

### Ensuring Code Qualiy

Make sure your code is formatted:

```shell
# Format current package.
go fmt
```

Ensure go code quality by using go vet and golint.

```shell
golint ./...
go vet ./...
```
