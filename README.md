# Otrego Community

Otrego is a community dedicate to working together to making better,
open-source software for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">board game go</a>, also known as igo
(囲碁), baduk (바둑), weiqi (围棋).

## Code of Conduct

In Otrego, we highly value developing a positive and supportive community. If
you would like to participate in the Otrego Community, please read our [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Developers Guide

If you're interesting in contributing to Otrego as a developer, check out our
[Contributing Guide!](CONTRIBUTING.md).

In particular, we have detailed guides in our [Getting Started](/gettingstarted/READMED.md) that cover:

1.   [Learning about the game go](/gettingstarted/gogame.md)
2.   [Getting started with golang](/gettingstarted/golang.md)
3.   [Setting up your editor](/gettingstarted/editor.md)
4.   [Getting Started with Git & Github](/gettingstarted/git.md)
5.   [Setting up Katago](/gettingstarted/katago.md)

## Github Issues

To help folks get up to speed with programming in the language Go (aka Golang)
or the other relevant languages used by the repository, we try to label issues
with approximate difficulty. Borrowing the ranking terminology used by the game
Go, we use the following labeling scheme:

*   `Difficulty:DDK` -- *(Double Digit Kyu)* Issues a beginner to programming
    in the language in the relevant repository (typically Golang) can tackle.
    Issues marked as `DDK` should be clearly marked with the expectations and
    requirements by experienced Contributors to Otrego.
*   `Difficulty:Kyu` -- *(Single Digit Kyu)* Issues an intermediate programmer
    in the relevant languages can tackle. Issues marked as `Kyu` should have
    clear scope, but can assume general comptency in unit-testing, language
    style, and algorithms.
*   `Difficulty:Dan` -- Issues an experienced programmer can tackle. `Dan`
    issues may have unclear scope, require complex algorithms, or require
    understanding & integrating with other technologies (Cloud Services,
    Authentication).
*   `Difficulty:Pro` -- Issues that only the most experienced contributors in
    Otrego should tackle. `Pro` issues frequently require significant design
    and significant understanding of the game Go.

We expect most issues to fall in either *Kyu* and *Dan* categories.
